# TensorFlow
*List of notebooks focused on TensorFlow*
***

## A note on the notebooks rendering
Each notebook has two versions (all python scripts are unaffected by this):
- One where all the markdown comments are rendered in black& white. These are placed in the folder named `GitHub_MD_rendering` where MD stands for MarkDown.
- One where all the markdown comments are rendered in colours.
***

## Installation
- `pip install tensorflow` starting with version 2.1, this will install the **GPU version** of TensorFlow by default.
- `pip install tensorflow-cpu` will install the **CPU version** of TF.
